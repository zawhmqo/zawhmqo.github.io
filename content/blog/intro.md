Hey there! I'm W'zamqo and I plan to talk about my adventures through technology in my blog Digital Solace. I'm a full-stack developer that lives in Ontario. Through blogging, I want to be able to get better at writing and learn more about this weird world we live in. I'm a fan of coffee and tea.

I want to learn more about these topics and cover them on this blog:

- Community building
- DevOps
- Full stack development
- Magick (just a little bit)
- A little bit of generative AI because that's what I work with professionally
- My coffee misadventures

This blog is dedicated to technology and getting better at its craft. If you are trying to get your foot in the industry, this blog is for you. I hope that the tales of my misadventures can help you learn. I'm sorry these earlier posts are probably going to be shorter, I'm re-learning how to write long form after relying too much AI and letting my writing ability wither. This is part of the reason I'm using the iconography of the [White Mage](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/White_Mage). I am healing as much as I am teaching.

This blog is a static site written with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). The blog is deployed by GitHub Actions from [zawhmqo/zawhmqo.github.io](https://github.com/zawhmqo/zawhmqo.github.io). I use the [Archie theme](https://github.com/athul/archie). I may end up forking it eventually, but it works well enough for now.

I was inspired to start this blog after reading about the [Lobsters Blog Carnival](https://lobste.rs/s/0nstyk/join_lobsters_blog_carnival). I've been lurking the [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) community for a while but never really felt like I had anything to contribute. I plan to contribute both to the blog carnival and take [some of the other proposals](https://lobste.rs/s/gwh1ys/lobsters_blog_carnival#c_m9pndn) into their own posts.

I hope to write at least one post a week. If you want to get updated when I post things, please [follow on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wzamqo.bsky.social). I have an [RSS feed](/index.xml) in case you want to subscribe in your RSS reader.
