Three years ago, the entire industry lost its fucking mind as [ChatGPT became the single fastest growing application ever](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2025/05/chatgpt-stats-in-numbers-growth-usage-and-global-impact.html). Investors saw that massive number jump and assumed that it would be like this permanmently. As a result, Generative AI has exploded so much that it's impossible to get approval to do anything with computers that does not involve it.

I think the biggest thing we've lost along the way is that the culture of designing and deploying truly reliable software based on best principles. No longer do we design things to actually solve problems, we just chase the hype and hope it works out. One of the biggest things I've noticed is that now you are expected to use generative AI tools directly in the loop when performing software development. You comply or be fired for the position to be filled by someone who will blindly follow the dogmatic instructions.

At this point, I just want to have a job where I'm contractually forbidden from working with AI. I mean it being a load-bearing contract violation. I not only don't want to work with it anymore, I want to expel generative AI from my stack so fully and wholly that it will never come back.

Of course, that simply won't happen. The slop machine will encroach ever more into our lives, making Google searches worthless and corrupting the very foundations of our modern lives until nothing remains sacred.

I just want to use computers in boring ways that fundamentally make people's lives easier. Is that really too fucking much to ask?
