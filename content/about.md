I'm a full-stack developer in Ontario. I'm dipping my toes into writing after my skills decayed due to the overuse of generative AI. I enjoy turn based role playing games and crafting the best ways to enjoy coffee and teas.

## Languages and Tools

- Go
- Rust
- React

I do all my coding with Visual Studio Code into a virtual machine running Arch Linux. It is a 4 core VPS with 4 GB of ram. I'm told that the VPS uses Zen 4 cores, but it's fast enough that I don't have to care.

## Name

W'zamqo Rhid is my proper formal name. If you don't know me well, please call me W'zamqo. If you know me very well, you may drop the W' prefix.
